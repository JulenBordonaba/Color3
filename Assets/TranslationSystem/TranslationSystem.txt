-The "TextID" column is to relation the database register with the game Text.
-The "LenguageID" column is to relation the text with on lenguage.
-The "Content" column is the translated text tath will appear in the game Text

Instructions:
-Add the TranslationManager to an object in the scene first scene loaded in the game, this will load all the data from the database
-Select the "Dont Destroy" parameter from the TranslatorManager
-Add a Translator to the texts you wanna translate
-Set the "TextID" parameter of the Translator, this will take the content from the database with the same TextID from the lenguage you are using in that moment
